print("Zach Reid\n9/16/2022\n\nFor the best results for a successfully managed project, I recommend that you start your project with management software there right from the start. This is a great thing to have and a very efficient thing to have when stuff needs to be shared and stored in a more cloud based way, you and everyone else who is working on said project with you will be able to be informed properly and more efficiently. For example even for smaller projects that I've been apart of, like a class group amount of people, have needed to get something done in our Highschool programing class, one of my partners always before anything else created some sort of discord repository just so we could all have access and communicate at a productive pace. So in conclusion I believe that If you don't have management software then you don't care about the project to its fullest extent.")
